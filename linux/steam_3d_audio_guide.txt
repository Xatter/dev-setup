Steam 3D Audio Setup Guide
==========================

For games that support 3D audio, use these launch options:

Basic 3D Audio (recommended):
    PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=60 %command%

For games with OpenAL support:
    PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=60 OPENAL_DRIVERS=pulse %command%

For Proton games that need Windows audio compatibility:
    PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=60 WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dsound=n" %command%

Games known to work well with HRTF:
- Counter-Strike 2
- Team Fortress 2
- Most Source engine games
- Games using OpenAL or Steam Audio
- Many Unity/Unreal games

Test your setup:
- Enable 3D Audio or Spatial Audio in game settings
- Look for "Headphone" mode options
- HRTF works best with stereo headphones
